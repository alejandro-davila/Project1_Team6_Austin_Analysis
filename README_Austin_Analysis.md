<h1 align="center">Data Analytics Project Proposal:  Investigating the Impact of Austin's Rapid Growth on Travis County and Surrounding Counties</h1>


<h1 align="center">Data Collection</h1>


In our investigation of the impact of recent population growth in Austin and the surrounding counties on local school performance metrics, we utilized the American Community Survey 1-Year Data API to collect information for the four most populous counties (Travis, Hays, Williamson, and Bastrop) during 2017, 2019, and 2021. The data we collected encompassed various topics, including population totals, median income, unemployment count, and population totals by race. Due to the limitations of the data source, we faced challenges, such as the absence of 2020 census data due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To maintain consistency, we compared odd years only and confined our time frame from 2017 to 2021. Simultaneously, we utilized the SchoolDigger.com API to access comprehensive records of schools nationwide, obtaining school ranking information, standardized test scores, and geographical coordinates for each school. Our focus was on data from the years 2019, 2021, and 2022, considering 2020's unavailability due to the pandemic. While this approach has inherent limitations, it provides us with a relevant perspective on recent growth and its potential impact on school performance in the Austin metro area.

<h2 align="center">Overall</h2>

Overall, three out of the four counties experienced a general upward trend in median income, indicating overall economic growth and potential job market improvements in the region.

The fluctuations in median income in Hays County and Bastrop County highlight the importance of diversifying the local economy to create more stable income opportunities.

Policies that support job creation, education, and workforce training could contribute to sustained economic growth and increased median incomes in these counties.

Affordable housing and cost-of-living considerations must be addressed to ensure that economic growth benefits all residents.

In conclusion, the data reflects positive trends in median incomes for most of the counties in Texas between 2017 and 2021. While these improvements indicate economic growth and prosperity, there is still room for targeted policies and investments to address disparities and create more inclusive economic opportunities for all residents. Continued monitoring of economic indicators will be essential to ensure that the region's growth remains sustainable and benefits the broader community.


<h1 align="center">Unemployment:</h1>


The data reveals fluctuations in unemployment figures for each county between 2017 and 2021. Hays County experienced a notable decrease in unemployment, suggesting an improvement in job opportunities and economic conditions. However, Travis County saw an increase in unemployment from 2017 to 2021, indicating potential challenges in its labor market. Further analysis is required to understand the factors contributing to these trends.

<p align="center">
<img width="424" alt="picture" src=https://github.com/alejandro-davila/Project1_Team6_Austin_Analysis/assets/135288005/fe34ec77-1fdc-4532-869f-bad26c14999c>

In conclusion, the data analysis shows strong evidence of an association between unemployment status and the county in Texas. The differences in unemployment rates among the counties are significant, and the null hypothesis of equal unemployment rates across all counties is rejected. Policymakers and local authorities in each county should use this information to implement targeted strategies and initiatives to address unemployment challenges specific to their region. Additionally, further investigation and research may be needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to these variations in unemployment rates among the counties.




<h1 align="center">Racial Demographics:</h1>

Racial demographics displayed varying patterns across the counties. Travis County had the most diverse population, with substantial numbers of White, Hispanic/Latino, and Black or African American residents. Williamson County had a predominantly White population, while Hays County and Bastrop County had significant Hispanic/Latino communities.

Over the four-year period, racial demographics experienced slight changes. The White population decreased in Travis County and Williamson County, while Hispanic/Latino populations increased in all four counties, especially in Travis County and Hays County. The Black or African American population remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations.

It's essential to recognize and study the implications of these demographic changes to address any disparities and promote inclusivity and cultural understanding.


<h1 align="center">School Data</h1>

Let's take a deeper dive into one county. Travis county, the heart of Austin, Tx. Based on the linear regression equation and correlation coefficient, we can analyze the data as follows:

<h2 align="center">Net Rank Movement vs. Distance to City Center</h2>

The negative slope (-22.31) in the regression equation indicates that there is a negative relationship between the net rank movement of schools and their distance from the city center. As the distance to the city center increases, the net rank movement tends to decrease. This suggests that schools located farther from the city center may experience less improvement or potentially decline in their rankings compared to schools closer to the city center.

The correlation coefficient (r-value) of -0.364096423 indicates a weak negative correlation between net rank movement and distance to the city center. Although the correlation is not very strong, it still suggests that there is some tendency for schools located closer to the city center to have slightly higher net rank movements compared to schools located farther away. However, it's important to note that the correlation is weak, and there might be other factors contributing to school rank movements.

The same can be said when analyzing the Highschool, Middle School, and Elementary data movement.

<h1 align="center">Austin Crime</h1>

<h1 align="center">Based on the provided data for the top 5 crimes in 2019, 2021, and 2022, here is the analysis</h1>

<h3 align="center">Top 5 Crimes</h3>

The top 5 crimes remained consistent over the three years, with slight variations in their rankings. "Family Disturbance" and "Theft" were consistently among the top 5 crimes in all three years. "Burglary of Vehicle" and "Criminal Mischief" were also prevalent crimes, though their rankings changed between the years. "Auto Theft" was not in the top 5 crimes in 2019 but became one of the top 5 crimes in 2021 and 2022.

<h3 align="center">Yearly Trends</h3>

The line chart showed fluctuations in the occurrence of the top 5 crimes over the years. While some crimes experienced a consistent decline (e.g., "Burglary of Vehicle" and "Theft"), others showed slight variations.

<h3 align="center">Yearly Percentage Change</h3> 

The percentage change from 2019 to 2021 indicated that most of the top crimes decreased in occurrence during this period, except for "Auto Theft," which saw a significant increase. The percentage change from 2019 to 2022 showed that "Family Disturbance," "Burglary of Vehicle," and "Theft" continued to decrease, while "Auto Theft" further increased. "Criminal Mischief" decreased but to a lesser extent compared to the other years.

<h3 align="center">Insights</h3> 

The decrease in certain crimes, such as "Burglary of Vehicle" and "Theft," suggests that law enforcement or community initiatives may have been successful in reducing these types of crimes. On the other hand, the increase in "Auto Theft" may signal a new trend that requires attention from law enforcement agencies.

<h3 align="center">Limitations</h3>

It's essential to consider that the analysis is based on a limited dataset and only includes the top 5 crimes. A more comprehensive analysis would require a broader range of crime data, including other types of offenses and geographical areas. Additionally, external factors, such as changes in law enforcement strategies or socioeconomic conditions, could influence crime trends, and further investigation would be necessary to understand these dynamics fully.

































<h2 align="center">Interpretation Limitations</h2>

It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis. The data analysis is based on available data and the assumptions made during the data collection and processing. The results may be influenced by other variables not included in the current analysis, such as school funding, demographics, teaching quality, and local policies.


























<h2 align="center">Cautions with Interpretation</h2>

Remember that correlation does not imply causation. While the analysis indicates a relationship between distance to the city center and net rank movement, it does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Other factors and confounding variables may be influencing the observed trends.
