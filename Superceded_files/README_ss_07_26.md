<h1 align="center">Data Analytics Project Proposal: Analyzing Housing Values in Top Metro Areas of Texas</h1>

<h1 align="center">1. Introduction</h1>

The objective of this data analytics project is to explore the potential indicators that influence housing values in the top four metro areas of Texas: Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. By analyzing various factors related to economic, social, and demographic aspects, we aim to understand the correlations and identify the most significant drivers affecting the real estate market in these regions.

<h1 align="center">2. Objectives</h1>

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

•    Identify key indicators that exhibit a strong association with housing values in the selected metro areas.

•    Analyze the relationships between the chosen indicators and housing prices to determine their impact.

•    Develop predictive models to estimate housing values based on relevant indicators.

•    Provide actionable insights and recommendations for potential homebuyers, investors, and policymakers.

## 3.1 Data Collection
We will gather comprehensive data from various sources, including government databases, real estate agencies, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, and crime statistics repositories. The data will encompass the following indicators:

1.    Business Development: Data on recent business investments, startups, and job creation in each metro area. (TBD)
2.    Property Tax Values: Property tax assessment data for residential properties in different neighborhoods. (TBD)
3.    Median Income: Average household income data for each metro area. (Y)
4.    School Rating: Educational quality ratings and performance metrics for schools within the regions. (M)
5.    Poverty Rating: Data on poverty rates in different neighborhoods within the metro areas. (Y)
6.    Commercial Development: Information on the development and occupancy of commercial properties. (TBD)
7.    Unemployment Levels: Data on the employment status and unemployment rates in each metro area. (Y)
8.    Job Openings Available: Number of job openings and employment opportunities in various industries. (TBD)
9.    Crime Levels: Crime statistics and safety indices for different neighborhoods within the metro areas. (M)
10.   Education Demographics: Demographic makeup of local population (Y) 
11.    Charter to District School Ratio: Proportion of charter schools to public schools and their potential impact on housing prices. (TBD)
12.    Access to Healthcare: Availability and quality of healthcare facilities in each metro area. (N)
13.    Racial Distribution: Demographic data on racial and ethnic groups within neighborhoods. (Y)
14.    Religious Participation: Data on religious institutions and their potential correlation with housing prices. (N)


## 3.2 Data Analysis

We will employ a combination of exploratory data analysis, statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms to achieve the project objectives:

•    Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

•    Correlation analysis to identify potential relationships between housing prices and the selected indicators.

•    Regression analysis to develop predictive models for housing values based on influential factors.

•    Geospatial analysis to visualize geographical patterns and hotspots of housing prices and indicators.

## 3.3 Interpretation and Visualization

The findings will be presented through clear and interactive data visualizations, including graphs, heatmaps, choropleth maps, and scatter plots. Interpretation of the results will be carried out in conjunction with the research questions and objectives to provide meaningful insights into the factors affecting housing values in each metro area.

<h1 align="center">4. Deliverables</h1>

The project will deliver the following:

1.    Comprehensive data analysis report with insights, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling results.
2.    Interactive data visualizations to aid in understanding patterns and relationships.
3.    Recommendations for stakeholders, such as potential homebuyers, real estate investors, and local policymakers, based on the analysis.
