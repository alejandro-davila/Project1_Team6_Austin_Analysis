<h1 align="center">Data Analytics Project Proposal:  Investigating the Impact of Austin's Rapid Growth on Travis County and Surrounding Counties</h1>

<h1 align="center">Analysis of Central-Texas Data (2017 to 2021)</h1>

The provided data presents a snapshot of key demographic and socioeconomic indicators for four counties in Texas, namely Travis County, Hays County, Williamson County, and Bastrop County, for the years 2017 and 2021.

<h2 align="center">Overall</h2>

Overall, three out of the four counties experienced a general upward trend in median income, indicating overall economic growth and potential job market improvements in the region.

The fluctuations in median income in Hays County and Bastrop County highlight the importance of diversifying the local economy to create more stable income opportunities.

Policies that support job creation, education, and workforce training could contribute to sustained economic growth and increased median incomes in these counties.

Affordable housing and cost-of-living considerations must be addressed to ensure that economic growth benefits all residents.

In conclusion, the data reflects positive trends in median incomes for most of the counties in Texas between 2017 and 2021. While these improvements indicate economic growth and prosperity, there is still room for targeted policies and investments to address disparities and create more inclusive economic opportunities for all residents. Continued monitoring of economic indicators will be essential to ensure that the region's growth remains sustainable and benefits the broader community.


<h1 align="center">Unemployment:</h1>


The data reveals fluctuations in unemployment figures for each county between 2017 and 2021. Hays County experienced a notable decrease in unemployment, suggesting an improvement in job opportunities and economic conditions. However, Travis County saw an increase in unemployment from 2017 to 2021, indicating potential challenges in its labor market. Further analysis is required to understand the factors contributing to these trends.

In conclusion, the data analysis shows strong evidence of an association between unemployment status and the county in Texas. The differences in unemployment rates among the counties are significant, and the null hypothesis of equal unemployment rates across all counties is rejected. Policymakers and local authorities in each county should use this information to implement targeted strategies and initiatives to address unemployment challenges specific to their region. Additionally, further investigation and research may be needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to these variations in unemployment rates among the counties.




<h1 align="center">Racial Demographics:</h1>

Racial demographics displayed varying patterns across the counties. Travis County had the most diverse population, with substantial numbers of White, Hispanic/Latino, and Black or African American residents. Williamson County had a predominantly White population, while Hays County and Bastrop County had significant Hispanic/Latino communities.

<p align="center">

Over the four-year period, racial demographics experienced slight changes. The White population decreased in Travis County and Williamson County, while Hispanic/Latino populations increased in all four counties, especially in Travis County and Hays County. The Black or African American population remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations.

It's essential to recognize and study the implications of these demographic changes to address any disparities and promote inclusivity and cultural understanding.
