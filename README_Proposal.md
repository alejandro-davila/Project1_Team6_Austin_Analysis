<h1 align="center">Data Analytics Project Proposal:  Investigating the Impact of Austin's Rapid Growth on Travis County and Surrounding Counties</h1>

<h1 align="center">1. Introduction</h1>

The American Growth Project has reported that Austin was the second fastest growing city in the US in 2022. This unprecedented growth can have far-reaching effects on the city and its surrounding areas. In this project, we aim to analyze the changes that have occurred in Travis County, where Austin is located, and the neighboring counties. By examining key indicators such as population, median income, unemployment levels, crime rates, school rankings, and racial demographics, we seek to understand the implications of this growth and make predictions for potential future developments if this growth trend continues.

<h1 align="center">2. Objectives</h1>

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

•    To analyze and compare data from various years, focusing on years prior to 2022 (e.g., 2020 and earlier), to understand the trends leading up to Austin's rapid growth.

•    To examine changes in specific areas of interest, including population dynamics, economic indicators, crime rates, education, and demographic shifts in Travis County and surrounding counties.

•    To identify correlations between the growth of Austin and its effects on the aforementioned areas.

•    To make informed predictions about the potential outcomes if the growth trend persists.

<img width="424" alt="ratlabs" src=https://github.com/alejandro-davila/Matplotlib_Module5/assets/135288005/66362c83-fc41-4868-9aab-9a2bd76623ae>

1.    Data Collection: We will gather relevant data from various sources, such as U.S. Census Bureau, schooldigger.com, and City of Austin crime statistics. The selected years for analysis will include data for years up to 2022 (excluding years as needed due to potential pandemic-related data inconsistencies).

2.   Data Analysis: We will employ statistical methods to analyze the collected data. This will involve examining trends, calculating growth rates, and identifying correlations between Austin's growth and the selected indicators in the respective counties.

3.    Comparative Study: We will compare the data from Travis County with that of surrounding counties to ascertain the differences in growth and its impacts on the various areas of interest.

4.    Predictive Analysis: Utilizing the findings from our analysis, we will make predictions about potential outcomes in the future if the growth trend continues at its current rate or follows similar patterns.


<h1 align="center">4. Areas of Interest</h1>

•    Population: Analyzing the growth rate of Austin and its impact on population dynamics in Travis County and surrounding areas.

•    Median Income: Studying changes in household income to understand the economic implications of the city's growth.

•    Unemployment Levels: Investigating the correlation between Austin's growth and the unemployment rates in the region.

•    Crime Rates: Assessing any potential impact on crime rates as a result of population growth.

•    School Rankings: Examining how the growth affects the performance and rankings of schools in the area.

•    Racial Demographics: Studying shifts in racial demographics to identify any disparities resulting from the growth.


<h1 align="center">5. Expected Outcomes</h1>

We anticipate that our analysis will provide valuable insights into the effects of Austin's rapid growth on Travis County and neighboring areas. By identifying correlations and trends in the selected indicators, we hope to make informed predictions about potential future developments. Our findings could be instrumental in guiding local policymakers, urban planners, and community leaders in managing the growth effectively and sustainably.

<h1 align="center">6. Deliverables</h1>

The project will deliver the following:

1.    Comprehensive data analysis report with insights, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling results.
2.    Interactive data visualizations to aid in understanding patterns and relationships.
